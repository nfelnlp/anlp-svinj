#Political text classification

A classifier for radically right- and left-wing texts.

The main file is model/default_clf.py. In order to run it, navigate to the model directory.

default_clf.py will first train a classifier based on a training corpus and then test the classifier.

There are a number of command line options for default_clf.py:
* -f ... choose which features to use
       options: ngrams, named_ents, sentiment, artlen, sentlen, POS, quoted
* -n ... set number of named entities to use (default: 200)
* -s ... decide, whether to use a short training and test corpus (for debugging purposes)
* -u ... set, which test corpus to use
  *     y, yes ... use outlets from which there weren't any articles in the training corpus
  *     n, no ... use outlets from which there were articles in the training corpus
* -1 ... set number of unigrams to use (default: 10000)
* -2 ... set number of bigrams to use (default: 2000)
